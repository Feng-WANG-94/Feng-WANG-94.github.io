<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a postdoctoral research fellow working with Prof. [Tony Q. S. Quek](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/) at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I obtained my Ph.D. in Navigation, Guidance and Control at Dec. 2022 under the guidance of Prof. Dingde Jiang from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), where I also completed my B.S. in Information and Computational Science at Jul. 2016. During my doctoral studies, I also spent one year as a visiting Ph.D. student at SUTD under the guidance of Prof. Tony Quek.

My research interest includes connectivity management in integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTN), hybrid FSO/RF networking & routing in GEO-MEO-LEO satellite networks, and service orchestration for space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN).
